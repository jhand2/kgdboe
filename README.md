# KGDBoE - Debug Linux Kernel via Network

KGDBoE is a Linux Kernel Module initially developed by Sysprogs to support debugging
the Linux kernel over a network interface. More details can be found on the [Sysprogs
website](https://sysprogs.com/VisualKernel/kgdboe/).

I am using this fork to do staging work in an attempt to upstream this module to the
mainline linux kernel.
